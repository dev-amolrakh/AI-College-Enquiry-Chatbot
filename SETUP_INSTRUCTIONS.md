## Troubleshooting

### üö® MOST COMMON ISSUE: CORS Error

**If you're getting fallback responses instead of AI responses:**

1. **Check if you're running on a server** (not file://)

   - ‚ùå Wrong: Opening `index.html` directly in browser
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Running on `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Start a local server:**

   - **Windows**: Double-click `start-server.bat`
   - **Python**: `python -m http.server 8000`
   - **Node.js**: `npx serve .`
   - **VS Code**: Install "Live Server" extension

3. **Test with debug page:**
   - Open `test-server.html` to diagnose issues
   - Check console for detailed error messages

### If the chatbot isn't responding:

1. **Open browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console) and look for errors
2. **Check API key**: Make sure it's properly set in `chatbot.js`
3. **Test API connection**: Use the debug page (`test-server.html`)
4. **Verify internet connection**
5. **The enhanced fallback system** now provides detailed responses even offline

### If you get API errors:

1. **API key invalid**: Double-check you copied the complete key from Groq
2. **Rate limits**: Wait a minute and try again (30 requests/minute limit)
3. **Network issues**: Check your internet connection
4. **Server required**: Make sure you're running on localhost, not file://

### Common Issues & Solutions:

- **CORS Error**: ‚ûú Use local server (see above)
- **API Key Invalid**: ‚ûú Get new key from console.groq.com
- **No Response**: ‚ûú Check JavaScript is enabled
- **Fallback Only**: ‚ûú Check console for API errors
- **Server won't start**: ‚ûú Try different port: `python -m http.server 3000`

## Customization Options

### Change the AI Model:

In `chatbot.js`, modify line 4:

```javascript
const MODEL_NAME = "llama-3.2-11b-text-preview"; // Current default (recommended)
// or
const MODEL_NAME = "llama-3.2-3b-text-preview"; // For faster responses
// or
const MODEL_NAME = "llama-3.2-90b-text-preview"; // Most capable (slower)
```

### Adjust Response Style:

Modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `chatbot.js` to change how the AI responds.

### Add More Colleges:

Update the system prompt and college data to include more institutions.
